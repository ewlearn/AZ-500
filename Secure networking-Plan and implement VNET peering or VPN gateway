Secure networking-Plan and implement VNET peering or VPN gateway

  planning and implementing VNet peering or VPN gateway

1. Understand the concept of virtual network (VNet) peering and how it can be used to connect Azure VNets. 

2. Understand the concept of Azure VPN gateway and how it can be used to connect Azure VNets to on-premises networks. 

3. Identify the different types of VNet peering in Azure, including same-subscription peering and cross-subscription peering. 

4. Use Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the Azure portal to create, modify, and delete VNet peering connections. 

5. Implement VNet peering to enable communication between Azure VNets without the need for a VPN connection. 

6. Configure VNet peering to enable traffic flow between VNets in different regions or Azure regions. 

7. Use VNet peering to implement hub-and-spoke architectures, where a central VNet acts as a hub and other VNets act as spokes. 

8. Implement VNet peering to share services, such as virtual machines or virtual network gateways, across VNets. 

9. Monitor and troubleshoot VNet peering using Azure Network Watcher and other Azure monitoring tools. 

10. Identify the different types of VPN connections supported by Azure VPN gateway, including Point-to-Site (P2S), Site-to-Site (S2S), and ExpressRoute. 

11. Use Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the Azure portal to create, modify, and delete VPN gateway connections. 

12. Implement Azure VPN gateway to provide secure connectivity between Azure VNets and on-premises networks. 

13. Configure Azure VPN gateway to enable traffic flow between VNets in different regions or Azure regions. 

14. Use Azure VPN gateway to implement hybrid architectures, where on-premises networks are connected to Azure VNets. 

15. Implement Azure VPN gateway to provide secure remote access to virtual machines and other resources within Azure VNets. 

16. Monitor and troubleshoot Azure VPN gateway using Azure Network Watcher and other Azure monitoring tools. 

17. Ensure that VNet peering and VPN gateway configurations are properly documented and regularly reviewed to ensure their effectiveness and alignment with organizational policies. 

18. Implement security controls, such as network security groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall, to protect VNet peering and VPN gateway connections from unauthorized access and tampering. 

19. Use Azure Policy to enforce VNet peering and VPN gateway configurations and ensure compliance with organizational policies and standards. 

20. Regularly test VNet peering and VPN gateway configurations to ensure that they are functioning as expected and not causing unintended disruptions to traffic flow.
